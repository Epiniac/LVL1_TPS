# Test Password Strength

Welcome to the **Test Password Strength** project! This small cybersecurity learning tool helps you test and analyze the strength of your passwords. It is designed to educate users on password security, demonstrating the importance of strong, complex passwords and how they can be assessed.

## Overview

In todayâ€™s digital age, password security is more important than ever. Weak passwords are a major vulnerability in many systems. This project provides a way to analyze the strength of your passwords by checking various factors such as length, character variety, and susceptibility to common password-cracking methods.

This tool will allow you to:
- Test the strength of a password based on key criteria (length, character complexity, common patterns).
- Learn about password best practices and why strong passwords matter.
- Explore how different password types are evaluated and what makes them strong or weak.

## Features

- **Length Check**: Passwords longer than 12 characters are typically much stronger.
- **Character Variety**: Includes checks for upper-case letters, lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Common Patterns**: Detects common password patterns (like `123456`, `password`, etc.).
- **Strength Feedback**: Provides feedback on how to improve your password based on the strength evaluation.
- **Password Scoring**: Assigns a strength score based on complexity and length.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using the following technologies:
- **Python**: Main programming language for password evaluation and logic.
- **Flask** (Optional): If using a web interface for testing passwords online.
- **Regular Expressions**: For pattern detection and password validation.
- **bcrypt**: For hashing passwords and demonstrating secure storage practices (optional).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- If using Flask for a web interface, you will need to install Flask.

### Steps

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/test-password-strength.git
    cd test-password-strength
    ```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the script (for a command-line version):
    ```bash
    python3 test_password_strength.python3
    ```
    Or start a web server (using Flask):
    ```bash
    python3 app.py
    ```
